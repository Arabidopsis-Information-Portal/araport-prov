* Updated Sources.yml example to illustrate list-based approach to authors and their sponsors
* Added concept of 'role' to author to allow folks to claim credit for specific types of effort
* Added concept of citations to allow multiple text or URL/DOI citations per source
* Added concept of links to each source
* Defined mandatory vs optional for each field
* Described expected inputs for each field
* Described mapping to common ontologies for as many fields as possible. Need to visit current mappings in light of revisions and also investigate potential mappings for new concept fields
